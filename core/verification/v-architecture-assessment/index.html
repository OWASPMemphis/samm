<h1 id="short-description">Short Description</h1>

<p>Validate the security and compliance of the software and supporting infrastructure architecture.</p>

<h1 id="long-description">Long Description</h1>

<p>Validate the security of the software and supporting infrastructure architecture. Identify application and infrastructure architecture components. For each interface note any security-related functionality and check the model for design-level consistency for how interfaces with similar access are secured. Also iterate through the list of security mechanisms and analyze the system for their provision.</p>

<p>Validate the software and supporting infrastructure architecture against known security requirements, compliance goals and best practices. The overall goal is to verify that each requirement and best practice has been addressed by the system design. Any requirements that are not met at the design level should be noted as assessment findings.</p>

<p>For each of the application and infrastructure components, review their effectiveness to secure the application. Any findings should feedback into the Security Architecture practice.</p>

<p>This analysis should be conducted by security-savvy staff with assistance from the project team for application-specific knowledge. This analysis should be performed upon major architecture changes, usually toward the end of a design phase.</p>

**Notes**
* Combine both streams into 1 (positive side of review). (DONE)
Create a new one (negative side of review) to focus on verifying that assumptions in the design (e.g. threat assessments) are still meeting the functionality of the application.
Can also include activities included in an app’s risk profile.
* There is a risk that the A stream will contain far more content than the B stream.

<h2 id="maturity-1-identify-application-and-infrastructure-architecture-components">Maturity 1 - Identify application and infrastructure architecture components</h2>

<h3 id="benefit">Benefit</h3>

<p>Identifying components on the software and supporting infrastructure helps developers understand the architecture, interfaces and how to secure them.</p>

<h3 id="activity">Activity</h3>

<p>Identify application and infrastructure architecture components. Create a simplified view of the overall architecture. Typically, this should be created based on project artifacts such as high-level requirements and design documents, interviews with technical staff, or module-level review of the code base.
Also identify the infrastructure components. These are all the systems, components and libraries (including SDKs) that are not specific to the application, but provide direct support to use or manage the application(s) in the organisation.
From the architecture view, analyze each component in terms of accessibility of the interfaces from authorized users, anonymous users, operators, application-specific roles, etc.
For each interface note any security-related functionality and check the model for design-level consistency for how interfaces with similar access are secured. Any breaks in consistency can be noted as assessment findings.</p>

#### Notes
Use of checklists
Review the design choices in each of the key vulnerability categories defined by the security frame. (TBD)

Supporting architecture are all the systems, components and libraries (including SDKs) that are not specific to the application, but provide direct support to use or manage the application(s) in the organisation.
Examples:
build / deployment systems
0auth, SSO, LDAP, ADFS, IAM, Firebase Authentication, ...
Web services, application services/framework (e.g. .NET framework), middleware, ESBs, ...
(Cloud) Storage, Backup
Analytics, Monitoring,
(cloud) acceleration, load balancing, WAF, (D)DOS protection
Does this include connectivity, networking, OS (?)

remarks:
by combining application and supporting architecture, we can introduce an extra activity stream (DONE)
threat modeling as a verification activity versus design? (TBD)

<h2 id="maturity-2-validate-the-architecture-security-mechanisms">Maturity 2 - Validate the architecture security mechanisms</h2>

<h3 id="benefit-1">Benefit</h3>

<p>This activity validates the security mechanisms on the attack surface of the sofware and infrastructure architecture.</p>

<h3 id="activity-1">Activity</h3>

<p>For each interface in the application and infrastructure architecture, formally iterate through the list of security mechanisms and analyze the system for their provision. This type of analysis should be performed on both internal interfaces, e.g. between tiers, as well as external ones, e.g. those comprising the attack surface.</p>

<p>The six main security mechanisms to consider are authentication, user access management, input validation, output encoding, error handling and logging. Where relevant, also consider the mechanisms of cryptography or privacy. For each interface, determine where in the system design each mechanism is provided and note any missing or unclear features as findings. Also identify the high-risk design decisions that have been made as part of the architecture and validate these.</p>

<p>This analysis should be conducted by security-savvy staff with assistance from the project team for application-specific knowledge. This analysis should be performed upon major architecture changes, usually toward the end of a design phase. After initial analysis, subsequent analysis is required to update the findings based on changes being made during the development cycle.</p>

<h3 id="activity-2">Activity</h3>

<p>Review of the architecture components effectiveness. Are the architecture security mechanisms well implemented? For each of the application and infrastructure components, review their effectiveness to secure the application.</p>

<p>Effectiveness should be evaluated for the security mechanisms provided by the components in terms of identification, protection, detection, response and recovery of security or privacy issues. Review their effectiveness in terms of strategy alignment, appropriate support and scaleability.
Any findings should feedback into the Security Architecture practice.</p>

<h3 id="benefit-3">Benefit</h3>

<p>Assures that the compliance requirements of the architecture are met.</p>

<h3 id="activity-3">Activity</h3>

<p>Ad-hoc review of the architecture against compliance requirements. Compliance requirements, either formally identified or informally known, should be identified and collected.</p>

<p>Review each item on the list of known compliance requirements against the architecture. Elaborate the analysis to show the design-level features that address each compliance requirement. The overall goal is to verify that each known compliance requirement has been addressed by the system design. Any compliance requirements that are not clearly provided at the design level should be noted as assessment findings.</p>

<p>This analysis should be conducted by security-savvy technical staff with input from architects, developers, managers, and business owners as needed. It should be updated during the design phase when there are changes in compliance requirements or high-level system design.</p>

<h3 id="benefit-4">Benefit</h3>

<p>This activity assures that the architecture is aligned with the security requirements and best practices.</p>

<h3 id="activity-4">Activity</h3>

<p>Analyze the architecture against known security requirements and best practices. Security requirements, either formally identified or informally known, should be identified and collected. Additionally, identify and include any security assumptions upon which safe operation of the system relies.</p>

<p>Review each item on the list of known security requirements against the architecture. Elaborate the analysis to show the design-level features that address each security requirement. Separate, detailed analysis iterations can be performed on parts of the architecture to simplify capturing this information if the system is large and/or complex. The overall goal is to verify that each known security requirement has been addressed by the system design. Any security requirements that are not clearly provided at the design level should be noted as assessment findings.</p>

<p>This analysis should be conducted by security-savvy technical staff with input from architects, developers, managers, and business owners as needed. It should be updated during the design phase when there are changes in security requirements or high-level system design.</p>
