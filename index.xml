      <description>The mission of OWASP SAMM is to be the prime maturity model for software assurance that provides an effective and measurable way for all types of organizations to analyse and improve their software security posture. OWASP SAMM supports the complete software lifecycle, including development and acquisition, and is technology and process agnostic. It is intentionally built to be evolutive and risk-driven in nature.
The original model (v1.0) was written by Pravir Chandra and dates back from 2009.</description>

      <description>Agile notes explain to the SAMM reader how topic specifically works for agile. They also provide best practices and pitfalls.
Rob van der Veer and Michael Kuipers agreed with the SAMM group that they would start adding agile notes to SAMM’s core model. Just to imagine how they would work: in the 2.0 core PDF, these notes could for example be presented in rectangles marked ‘Agile note’ and then contain the note text.</description>

      <guid>https://owaspsamm.org/core/governance/g-education-guidance/</guid>
      <description>Short Description Long Description The Education &amp;amp; Guidance (EG) Practice is focused on arming personnel involved in the software lifecycle with knowledge and resources to design, develop, and deploy secure software. With improved access to information, project teams will be better able to proactively identify and mitigate the specific security risks that apply to their organization.
One major theme for improvement across the Objectives is providing training for employees and increasing their security awareness, either through instructor-led sessions or computer-based modules.</description>

      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://owaspsamm.org/core/operations/o-environment-management/</guid>
      <description>Short Description Environment Management practice describes proactive activities carried out in order to keep the environment reasonably secure during the application operation.
Long Description Proactive work invested in application security is not over once the application becomes operational, on the contrary: New security features and patches are being usually continuously released until the technology stack you&amp;rsquo;re relying on becomes end of life.
Most technology you&amp;rsquo;re relying on within your application stack is not coming secure by default.</description>

      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://owaspsamm.org/core/operations/o-incident-management/</guid>
      <description>Short Description Incident Management security practice describes activities carried to detect and respond to security incidents.
Long Description Once your applications become operational, you’re likely to face security incidents. For this document, we consider a security incident a breach or threat of an imminent breach of at least one asset’s security goals due to malicious or negligent behaviour. Examples of a security incidents might include:
 successful DoS (Denial of Service) attack against a cloud application application user accessing private data of another one by abusing a security vulnerability attacker modifying the application source code  Sometimes, a security incident is detected only after months or even years when all damage has already been done.</description>

      <guid>https://owaspsamm.org/core/operations/o-operational-management/</guid>
      <description>Short Description Long Description The Operational Management practice focuses on activities to ensure security is maintained throughout operational support functions. Although these functions are not performed directly by an application, the overall security of the application and its data is dependent on their proper performance. All of the protections built into an application can be rendered irrelevant by deploying the application on an unsupported operating system with unpatched vulnerabilities, or failing to store backup media securely.</description>

      <guid>https://owaspsamm.org/core/governance/g-policy-compliance/</guid>
      <description>Short Description Long Description The Policy &amp;amp; Compliance (PC) Practice is focused on understanding and meeting external legal and regulatory requirements while also driving internal security standards to ensure compliance in a way that’s aligned with the business purpose of the organization.
A driving theme for improvement within this Practice is focused on describing organization&amp;rsquo;s standards and 3rd party obligations as application requirements, enabling efficient and automated audits that may be leveraged within the SDLC and continuously demonstrate that all expectations are being met.</description>

      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://owaspsamm.org/core/verification/v-requirements-driven-testing/</guid>
      <description>Short Description Create and integrate both positive (control verification) and negative (misuse/abuse testing) security tests based on requirements (user stories).
Long Description Conduct positive and negative security tests to verify that the software operates as expected. At a minimum, this means both testing the correct functioning of the standard software security controls, and fuzzing for vulnerabilities against the main input parameters of the application.
From the known security requirements, identify and implement a set of security test cases to check the software for correct functionality.</description>

      <guid>https://owaspsamm.org/core/design/d-security-architecture/</guid>
      <description>Short Description The security architecture practice focuses on managing architectural risks for the software solution.
Long Description This security practice focuses on the security linked to components and technology dealt with during the architectural design of your software solutions. Secure Architecture Design looks at (the selection and composition of) components that form the foundation of the solution that you&amp;rsquo;re building, with a particular focus on the security properties hereof. Technology management on the other hand looks at the security of supporting technologies that are used during development, deployment and operations, such as development stacks and tooling, deployment tooling, operating systems and tooling, etc.</description>
